# VisualizationForStravaCyclingPerformance

Visualization helps us to find a certain pattern and predict the 
behavior according to the data. As a cycling enthusiast, I have
collected my own training data and created several visualizations that 
describe my performance from the previous 8 months as well as 
analyze the segment's performance of tons of people. Through 
these two parts of visualization, we can first check if I am making 
any progress in my riding and then predict my possible 
performance on each segment.


Data used:

For ggplot2 vis:

    activity.csv: contain the activities I have for the past few month. Variables like Ave heart rate / power and cadence ...etc.

    segment.csv: include the finish time and the power ratio from different cyclist.

For Tableau vis:

    activity.twb / activity.hyper: contain the activities I have for the past few month. Variables like Ave heart rate / power and cadence ...etc.

    segment.twb / segment.hyper: include the finish time and the power ratio from different cyclist.

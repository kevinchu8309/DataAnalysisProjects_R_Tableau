# AirbnbDenverGroupProject
Our team has analyzed and identified the cheapest and most expensive neighborhoods Denver has to offer based on Airbnb listings. The observations made can help Airbnb in isolating neighborhoods for improving listing price generation and number of listings in Denver. In addition, we will give our best prediction of what price a certain unit should be rented out for, and offer suggestions on what should be highlighted in its listing based on various analyses. Finally weâ€™ll cover what percentage of Denver Airbnb units are full time rental properties and give suggestions to boost their occupancy and profitability which benefits both owners and Airbnb itself.
